      Here is where you can change certain aspects of your site, such as text and images. On the right, you will see descriptions of each of
      the menus on your dashboard. Some of the terms you will see:
    %p
      <strong>Events</strong> represent your events. These are your flyers, plus info like the date, time, and a title like "Awesome DJ Show." You can also set the location. It's advised to use the 'Get Info From Facebook' option, but you don't have to.
    %p
      <strong>Pages</strong> represent the different pages of your site, such as your homepage and "whatever.com/dogs", for example.
    %p
      <strong>Contents</strong> represent the different blocks of text on your webpages.
    %p

          %strong Edit
          will allow you to manage your events listed on the site. You can change the title, the flyer image, and the date. This is where
          you would go to delete events, as well.
        %p
          %strong Create New
          is where you would go to add a new event and its flyer to your site.

        %h4 Pages
        %p
          %strong Manage
          will allow you to see a listing of the pages of your site. Click an edit button to manage the contents of that page.
        %p
          %strong View
          will allow you to view your pages as any visitor would but with your dashboard at the top of the screen.
        %p
          A page is listed by what's called it's <strong>controller</strong> and it's <strong> action</strong>. Ex: your homepage is usually
          <strong>welcome#index</strong>. It's controller is <strong>welcome</strong> and it's action is <strong>index</strong>.
        %p
          If you had a page showing dogs, it would be <strong>dogs#index</strong>.
          A link to information on a specific dog would be <strong>dogs#show</strong>.
          This is the basic structure of most websites.
      .col-xs-3.admin-text.controls-index-menu-desc
        %h4 Contents
        %p
          Lists all the different blocks of text on your site for editing. This is a good menu to use to edit text that appears on more than
          one page.
        %p
          Contents, like graphics, are listed by their <strong>identifiers</strong>, which let your web browser know where to put and what to do with
          them.
        %p
          For example, if you owned a store and wanted to change your hours of operation, the <strong>identifier</strong> for that content
          would most likely be <strong>hours-of-operation</strong>.
        %p
          Each content listing will include the pages on your site on which it resides, listed by
          <strong>controller</strong> and <strong>action</strong>.
      .col-xs-3.admin-text.controls-index-menu-desc
        %h4 Graphics
        %p
          Lists all the different images used on your website that can be changed.
        %p
          Graphics, like contents, are listed by their <strong>identifiers</strong>. If you were to "open up the hood" on your site, you would
          see that these identifiers also contain instructions to a web browser on exactly where to put and how to size the images they represent.
        %p
          For example, if you wanted to change your company's logo, you would just have to find the graphic with an <strong>identifier</strong>
          named <strong>company-logo</strong>, or <strong>brand-image</strong>, etc.
        %p
          Each graphic listing will include the pages on your site that display this image, listed by <strong>controller</strong>
          and <strong>action</strong>.
